      content="My name is Man Yi (Ariel) Yeung. I’m a passionate programmer, currently searching for a software engineering position starting June 2022. I love programming because I love being hyper-focused when I'm coding. I enjoy how programming allows us to bring ideas to life and build interesting solutions to problems. In my spare time, I like to play piano and basketball. Recently, I just found new hobbies, painting and wall-climbing."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
